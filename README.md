# Reinforcement Learning - GridWorld and Q-Learning

This project explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts through the implementation of GridWorld and Q-Learning algorithms in Python. The primary objectives include understanding RL principles, implementing a GridWorld environment, and applying Q-Learning to solve the problem.

## Assignment Questions

### Question 1: GridWorld and Policy Iteration

In this section, we consider a 4x4 GridWorld environment with terminal and non-terminal states. Four available actions (up, down, left, right) are defined, along with deterministic state transitions and negative rewards (-1) for all transitions. The goal is to implement this environment and apply policy iteration to find an optimal policy.

### Question 2: Policy Iteration with Different Gamma

In this section, policy iteration is run with different discount factors (gamma). The question discusses the impact of setting gamma to 1 and explores why this causes the algorithm to run indefinitely.

### Question 3: Q-Learning Implementation

In this section, Q-Learning is implemented using the provided code skeleton. The goal is to optimize Q-values in a GridWorld environment with a given discount factor (gamma).
